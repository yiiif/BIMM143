```{r setup, include=FALSE}
knitr::opts_chunk$set(echo = TRUE)
```


First, let's check if "ggplot2" package is installed. And then, load the package.
```{r include=FALSE}
if (!require("ggplot2")) {
  install.packages("ggplot2")
}
```

```{r}
library(ggplot2)
```

## 1. Unix command

Here is a cheat sheet for the most commonly used commands.

## 2. ggplot2

Let's load the Blast sequences after command-line pipeline.
```{r}
data=read.csv("data/mm-second.x.zebrafish.tsv",sep="\t")
colnames(data)=c("qseqid", "sseqid", "pident", "length", "mismatch", "gapopen", "qstart", "qend", "sstart", "send", "evalue", "bitscore")
head(data)
```

```{r}
hist(data$bitscore,breaks=30)
```

We want to know if there is a straightforward relationship between percent identity (\$pident) and bitscore (\$bitscore) for the alignments we generated.
```{r}
ggplot(data, aes(pident, bitscore)) + geom_point(alpha=0.1) 
```

The answer is that bitscores are only somewhat related to pident; they take into account not only the percent identity but the length of the alignment. You can get a napkin sketch estimate of this by doing the following:
```{r}
ggplot(data, aes((data$pident * (data$qend - data$qstart)), data$bitscore)) + geom_point(alpha=0.1) + geom_smooth()
```
